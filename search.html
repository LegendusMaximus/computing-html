    <h1>How do search engines work?</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Crawlers go to websites that they know about, either from a link from another site or because the site has been submitted to the search engine</li>
        <li>The crawlers first look for information in the meta tags, so it is good to make sure you include helpful information there.</li>
        <li>They then check the title and any links from the page. They also visit any child pages of the website.</li>
        <li>They then check the last updated time, to check that the information is up-to-date and current. This may matter more for particular types of websites.</li>
    </ol>
