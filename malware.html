    <h1>What is ransomware?</h1>
<p>
Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts or locks you out of your personal files or programs.<br/>
Once files have been encrypted, the hackers normally ask for money in exchange for recovering the files.<br/>
Ransomware has hit the NHS and other massive organisations, and it is often spread by infected computers sending out emails to the computer's contact list.
