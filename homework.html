<h1 style="font-size:50px; font-family:arial; color:blue;>HTML tags</h1>
<p>A HTML page is built using tags. Web developers use tags to mark where parts of a web page should be in relation to the body of the document. Tags are made up of a < and > with a symbol in between. The symbol tells your web browser how the information enclosed between 
the tags should be treated.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

- em means that the text will become <i>italicised</i>
<br>- b means that the text will be <b>bold</b>

<p>The style of a tag can be changed. Between the brackets the keyword style can be used to change some properties.</p>

<p>For example:<p>

- style="color:red;" changes the text of the h3 tag to become:
<h3 style="color=red;">red</h3>
<p>- style="font-size:25px;" changes the text of the h3 tag to become size:
<h3 style="font-size:100px;">100px</h3>
