<h2 class="subheading">The start of the process</h2>
<p>The first step in digesting food is its breakdown by the mouth. Food is chewed so that it can be more easily moved into the main part of the digestive system.</p>

<h2 class="subheading">The breakdown of food</h2>h2>
<p>When the chewed food is received into the stomach, it is mixed with gastric juices that can break down the food into smaller, more soluble parts. The stomach grinds the food together with these juices so that they can be absorbed more easily into the body during the next stages.</p>p>

<h2 class="subheading">First absorption</h2>
<p>The small intestine is the starting point for the absorption of useful nutrients in the body's blood stream. The first part of the small intestine is the duodenum which continues further breakdown of the food. This is then passed further down the small intestine.</p>
